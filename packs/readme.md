# Packs

We need to compile packs from file formats we can control and directly or indirectly edit in comfortable manners. It does not seem feasible to only edit packs in the running Foundry, and overwrite packs in repository with the changed binaries. Instead the basics like skills or gear needs to be maintained in repository and compiled into the appropriate database format.
